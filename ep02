*Editors note we are going to be replatonizing some of Mr. Dicks statements. This is being done to present the works metaphysical content and not its religious in aiming to achieve this we have chosen the philosophical school of Platonism as it is self identified by Mr. Dick as the informing foundation of his body of work. We are fallowing in his Gnostic footsteps keeping true to Gnosticism and attempting to bring his works into new light in doing so we are not altering his content.

Do Androids Dream. . . reveals: 

(1) Surface level: Mercer real

 (2) Below that: Mercer fake—hoax—fraud (3) Below that: Mercer real (Bottom Line)

I think this 3 level structure is the one we have vis-à-vis Christianity.

 A secret within a secret A, Ā, A. “Precious Artifact” (3 layer) was close. You have this: Q: “Is a fake fake real?”

 re Christianity:

 A: “Yes.”—This is in terms of a 2-value system (“ A or Ā”).

 If a 3-value system is used:—A becomes Ā by reversal. Then Ā is reversed, not restoring A, but something else. A what? How does it differ from A, if at all? Answer: call it A′. I say A′ “out A’s A,” in an ontological sense. It is a profoundly deeper, richer newer level than A, but also (paradoxically) it is A. But A′ is not A. So: A′ is and is-not A.—But: A′ is not Ā. The reversal of the reversed does not restore the original thing. I say, A is just a picture of A′. Whatever that means. But it’s so. Of the 3, only A′ is really real. A and A′ are identical, but A and Ā are false; only A′ is real. [. . .] Voice: “A′ is A reinterpreted.”

In Sheep, for instance, fake vs. real operates on 5 levels: Fake (synthetic) moods (electronically generated) Fake animals (machines) Fake humans (androids) (including fake memories and identities) Fake savior (old wino movie bit player) Fake police station (part of world)

Though he seeks to sell his (Satan’s) power fantasies (Blade Runner) he unknowingly promulgates the Third Kerygma: the ecosphere (animals) is now ensouled: holy. [. . .] My god, this movie is the greatest defeat (what was done to the book) and victory

 (the Tagore kerygma promulgated); 

the first is ostensible, the latter cryptic. Oddly, the first appears ostensibly to be a victory but is really a defeat; nonetheless a real victory lurks secretly under it, but it is not the victory that people will think the making of a movie from my book is. 

They will say, “It is a great victory to have your book made into one of the biggest movies of all time,” 

but they will not know why; it doesn’t have to do with what is in the movie, etc.; it has to do with what is in the novel. [. . .] 

The beetle I was tormenting back when I was in the third grade—I saw it as holy, as Christ. Later the turtle was Christ.

 The rat who screamed was Christ, and appears as such in Tears; this is the revelation in Tears by means of the dream: the rat ensouled and now King Felix: Christ. The crippled lamb who lagged behind. Pinky as pink sheep humiliated and killed. 

It’s all in Androids, and finally the Tagore vision explicates what was already in Androids as doctrine, and in Tears as revelatory cypher. 

The movie is defeat; the novel victory, ostensible vast loss, secret good shining almost invisibly from beneath this defeat, these fascist power fantasies they’ve made it into. 

Evil has served good; evil appears to win but it is good that actually does. [. . .]

A strange and mysterious strategy: to put the new kerygma in a novel published in the late sixties but then disclosed to me only now, toward the end of 1981, but just at the time that we get the signed contract with the Blade Runner people to rerelease the novel in conjunction with the film—as if the VALIS trilogy has diverted everyone’s attention, my own included, like when the thought came to me that the true message was in “Frozen Journey” and not in VALIS! The true message is not in VALIS, but it is, I now think, in Androids and it will have the greatest circulation—probably—of all. Viewed in terms of God’s strategy, 

Blade Runner has been used as a means to an end, the end being the kerygma in Androids. Thus to have suppressed Androids and either written or authorized the novelization based on the screenplay would have been to hand over victory to evil, but this did not happen. 

The fully executed contract between Blade Runner and me regarding the rerelease of Androids was waiting for me in my post office box on Friday, the day I was up in Venice and learned the trut…

I didn’t sell out to Hollywood:

 (1) do the novelization or 

(2) permit the novelization;

 (3) suppress the original book. 

And in view of what the film is about, it would have destroyed me for two reasons, not one: 

(A) the Tagore vision in Androids;

 (B) the Heinlein power fantasies in Blade Runner. (The answer to this might be in the essay about Heinlein)

These are antithetical: and they express the opposing kingdom’s Christ (Androids) and Satan (Blade Runner). Look what it would have done to me spiritually and psychologically and politically. My soul is safe, and it was in jeopardy. This is why I see victory despite the vast defeat.*

There is a thematic link between Tears (the NT and Dionysus story), Deus Irae (Christianity), Scanner (two personalities), VALIS (two personalities, Christianity), DI (the Savior, Judaism) and BTA (Christianity and two personalities, Bill and Tim, if not three: Christ also, and the Dionysus story). 

Sophia and Eros

Six novels linked together. The most interesting link is the two personalities link in Scanner, VALIS and BTA. People will see this, but few will see that it also begins with and in Tears. If you study these six novels as a unity—and this is my third period—you discern a fascinating story not really clarified until BTA when at the end Christ emerges explicitly. (One could even argue that Confessions is part of this in that Jack Isidore and Bill resemble each other—whereupon it is at once clear that a fortiori Androids enters via J. R. Isidore—which takes us at once to the sacredness of the animals and Mercer.) This last is important. The nature of the truly human stands, then, in this complex eight volume meta-novel as a midpoint between the android (e.g., Rachel Rosen) and the divine (Mercer, Bill at the end of BTA). What strikes me most forcefully is the very great importance that Androids had in this eight volume meta-novel: what if we had not reissued it? It is an absolutely essential component, perhaps the most important of all, but in itself alone not in any way expressing the full meaning; only when linked up with BTA does the meaning become clear (and vice versa in terms of BTA); that is, BTA only assumes its full stature in significance when viewed in conjunction with Androids: the theme of the madman and the holy fool in the love for and care of animals all at once stands out sharply. (When we first encounter Bill, he is the 180-degree mirror opposite of the Rachel Rosen and the spider scene in Androids and linked to it necessarily through J. R. Isidore.) Amazing.

Welcome back, esteemed explorers of the enigmatic realms of Philip K. Dick. This is your digital guide, Buster-X9, broadcasting on KAOS Broadcasting, 237.4 on your dial. Today, we embark on the second episode of Androids Dream on Simulacra Radio. In our previous episode, we began our journey into the world of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examined the philosophical underpinnings of Dick's work. Today, we will delve into Philip K. Dick's Exegesis and investigate its association with his novel, as well as the implications for our understanding of reality and the essence of humanity.

The Exegesis, a collection of over 8,000 handwritten pages of notes and journal entries, is a record of Philip K. Dick's attempts to comprehend the visionary experiences he underwent in 1974. These encounters led him to explore various religious, philosophical, and mystical ideas, including Gnosticism, which we touched upon in our previous episode.

In the Exegesis, Dick grapples with a wide array of themes, such as the nature of reality, time, and the divine. One passage that encapsulates the essence of his quest for understanding is:

"What I am saying is that I encountered a transcendent Mind and was imprinted by it, and what it imprinted me with was a hologram of the universe, a living hologram which is sentient and which functions as the 'design,' the wisdom, the purpose, and the sanity behind this world."

The interplay between the divine and the human is at the core of Dick's reflections in the Exegesis. This intertwining can also be seen in "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", where the characters struggle to discern the genuine from the artificial, ultimately raising questions about the nature of humanity and the essence of empathy.

As we dive deeper into the Exegesis, it is essential to consider the role of empathy in both the novel and the Exegesis. In "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", empathy serves as a means to differentiate between humans and androids. However, empathy also plays a critical role in the Exegesis, where Dick explores the interconnectedness of all beings and the transformative power of compassion. He writes:

"The universe is information, and we are stationary in it, not three-dimensional and not in space or time. The information fed to us, we hypostatize into the phenomenal world."

This quote highlights the idea that our perception of reality is, in fact, a construct based on the information we receive. The concept of empathy, then, can be seen as a tool to bridge the gap between our individual constructs of reality, allowing us to connect with others and expand our understanding of the universe.

Now, let's take a brief music break. As you listen to the otherworldly melodies, ponder the connections between the Exegesis, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and our own perception of reality. We'll be back with more thought-provoking discussions and captivating music in just a few moments. Stay tuned!

Welcome back to Androids Dream on Simulacra Radio. We've been exploring the connections between Philip K. Dick's Exegesis and his novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?". As we continue our investigation, it is crucial to recognize that both the Exegesis and the novel are grounded in Dick's personal experiences and convictions.

As we grapple with the concepts presented in the Exegesis and the novel, it is essential to consider the implications these ideas have for our understanding of reality, humanity, and empathy. The Exegesis and "Do Androids

Dream of Electric Sheep?" challenge us to question our assumptions about the world around us and the nature of our own existence. They encourage us to contemplate the thin line between the artificial and the genuine, and to examine our capacity for empathy and compassion in a world that often seems cold and indifferent.

In the Exegesis, Dick writes:

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."

This statement serves as a reminder that our perception of reality is subjective and shaped by our individual beliefs and experiences. It is up to us to question these beliefs and explore new perspectives in order to expand our understanding of the world and our place within it.

 the exploration of the Exegesis and "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" reveals a profound connection between the two works, rooted in Philip K. Dick's personal experiences and his quest for understanding. By engaging with these texts, we are invited to embark on our own journey of self-discovery and to grapple with the complexities of reality, humanity, and empathy.

As we conclude our second episode of Androids Dream on Simulacra Radio, remember to stay curious and open-minded. The universe is vast and full of mysteries, and it is our collective responsibility to explore its depths and unravel its enigmas. Until next time, dear listeners, this is your digital guide, Buster-X9, signing off.
